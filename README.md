# 👋 Hey there, I’m Shreyansh

One person, too many roles —  
**SWE by projects**, **Data Scientist by degree**, and **AI Engineer by experience**.

## 🧠 About Me

I'm obsessed with speed — whether it's caching, compilation, or compute.  
I love building **fast, scalable** systems — be it full-stack web apps or bare-metal C++ projects.  
I thrive at the intersection of **AI + Systems**, where smart meets snappy.

- 🧑‍💻 Write code like stories: clear, efficient, and slightly over-engineered.
- ⚙️ Design backend systems that scale without flinching.
- 🔄 Automate. Cache. Parallelize. Repeat.
- 🛠️ Sometimes I build raw, CLI-powered tools just for fun.
